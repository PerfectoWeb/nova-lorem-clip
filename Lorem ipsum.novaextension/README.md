# Lorem Ipsum for Nova

A simple clip to generate "Lorem Ipsum" for your project with new IDE - [Nova](https://nova.app/). It's great way for generate more than 10 different and funny "Lorem Ipsum".

You spent time to search documentations for any actual platform to make multi-platform favicon and html meta tags. How much time left for the cross-platform favicon? Probably not much. But no worries, you only need a one click to tackle this task.

If that doesn't work, just clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!
